# Intro to Git and VS Code
### Facilitator: Diane López, Information Specialist

Wednesday, February 18, 2026 3:00 – 4:30 pm 

In this workshop, you will learn how to start using Git, a version control system, to track and manage your code with VS Code, a code editor with built-in Git support. We will walk you through the basics of Git version control and provide hands-on experience setting up Git in VS Code. You will learn how to back up your projects, track changes, and share your code with others. No prior experience is necessary. 

### Terms to know:

1. **directory** and **folder** are used interchangeably in Git and mean the same thing: a container for files and other folders. 

2. The three sections of Git workflow are: 
    - **working directory:** where you edit files
    - **staging area:** where you prepare changes
    - **.git directory:** where commits are stored

3. The three states of Git are: 
    - **modified** » changed the file
    - **staged** » modified file(s) ready for commit
    - **committed** » the file's snapshot is stored in the Git database

4. Branches:
    - **main** or **master** - the default branch (the primary version of your project)
    - **branch** branches are pointers to different parts of a project that allow a user to try or test code without affecting the main project branch. 
    - **remote** - a version of your repository hosted on GitHub


### Basic Terminal commands to know:
1. To show current working directory:
    - Windows: Use `cd` (without arguments) 
    - Mac/Linux: Use `pwd`
2. `cd <directory>`: change to new working directory/folder
3. `git init`: initiate Git repository
