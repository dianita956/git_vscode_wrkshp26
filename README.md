# Intro to Git and VS Code
### Facilatator: Diane López, Information Specialist

Wednesday, February 18, 2026 3:00 – 4:30pm 

In this workshop, you will learn how to start using Git, a version control system, to track and manage your code with VS Code, a code editor with built-in Git support. We will walk you through the basics of Git version control and provide hands-on experience setting up Git in VS Code. You will learn how to back up your projects, track changes, and share your code with others. No prior experience is necessary. 

## Terms to know:

1. **directory** and **folder** are used interchangeably in Git and mean the same thing: a container for files and other folders. 

2. the three sections of Git workflow that are: working directory, staging area, and .git directory

3. the three states of Git that occurred in its three sections are: **modified** » "changed the file"; **stage** » "modified file(s) ready for commit."; **committed** » the file's snapshot is stored in the Git database. 

### Commands to know:
1. pwd (mac) or cd (windows): current working directory/folder
2. cd: change to new working directory/folder
3. init: initate Git repository
